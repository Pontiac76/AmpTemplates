AMP Templates for use on retro machines

# About
AMP is a tool to manage game servers written by CubeCoders [https://cubecoders.com/]

The configurations in here are for use for a retro show I work in and this setup is "out of the ordinary" and potentially very insecure game servers are added.

The purpose for these "insecure" servers first started with Unreal Tournament 99.  I needed a very specific patch version of UT99 that wasn't provided by the new OldUnreal group.  The reason is that anything after patch 436, Windows 98 was no longer supported.  A group of us run a yearly retro computing show where we allow the public to use our old personal PCs to play these really old games.  Since one of the objectives of the 2025 show is to have a dedicated server running UT99GOTY, I needed to implement my own repository.

I don't think it wise to merge this into the main repository CubeCoders supports as this is way off the healthy.

# Security Concerns
The entire network is OFF GRID at the show.  No internet connectivity, no wireless access, 100% wired together via Ethernet, and someone is ALWAYS watching the computers.  You cannot get more of a siloed setup than this that allows communications between machines (Ok, maybe using Serial cables, but how do you run 11 computers off serial?)

I would NOT advise you use this on your regular daily run machines.
